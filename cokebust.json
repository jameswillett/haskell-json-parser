The entire song writing and recording session was truly a breeze with him. This record was by far the most \"collaborative\" effort and I think it shows as this is (IMO) the strongest Coke Bust recorded material yet. We were approached by Vaccine a year prior in the summer of 2011 about doing a split 7\". We were fresh off of Degradation and thought it would be a cool idea to do a split with a like-minded but also somewhat different band. Vaccine made total sense and fit that mission. Refuse Records in Europe was an obvious choice, having already worked on the Degradation EP together. Grave Mistake was hesitant about taking on a split 7\" of any kind (hey, lots of people don't like the format... it's cool), but Drugged Conscience was eager to take on the project. Chris Donaldson had been a friend for years so it just made sense working with him. This record came out just in time (down to the last day, actually) for our six week European tour. We sold a million of these things on the road. The two versions have different artwork.

Soon after the writing process for that split was complete we got word that they were going to be calling it quits. So, we wrote a handful of more songs and had the rest of what are now the Degradation songs, as well as the song \"Time Theft\" which we opted to put on the Short Fast and Loud #24 zine 10\" comp. We Omitted that song from this cluster because we felt that it didn't flow as well with these. These songs took us about a year to write after we got home from the US tour with Sick Fix in the Summer of 2009. We recorded them in Baltimore with Kevin Bernstein and Developing Nations studios. We told Kevin that we wanted this record to sound even more gnarly and blown out than the LP, and he suggested that we record using a reel to reel machine that he was planning on buying off one of his friends. So all the drums, guitars and bass were recorded analog and then individually dumped into pro-tools. The vocals were done digitally. This is probably our favorite recording, and we were completely sold on Kevin after this effort. After it was recorded in July, it took a long time to finally get mixed and sent to Poland for Refuse Records to put it out.

Refuse put out the first batch of these in Europe, and then Grave Mistake Pressed them in early 2011 for US distribution. The two records have different cover designs, but the music is the same.
